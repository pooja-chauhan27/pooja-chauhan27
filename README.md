- 👋 Hey there, I'm Pooja (@pooja-chauhan27), a passionate front-end developer diving deep into the world of web design and development. With an eye for detail and a love for clean, efficient code.
- 👀 I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities of front-end technologies and the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm honing my skills in the latest front-end frameworks and libraries, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the browser.
- 💞️ I'm keen to collaborate on projects that challenge me to think outside the box and push the boundaries of web design.
